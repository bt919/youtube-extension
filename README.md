# A chrome extension to delete youtube home feed

## If you would like to run this, then do the following

1. Download this repo, and take note of its file location
2. In chrome, type in chrome://extensions, and hit enter
3. Toggle developer mode (it's on top right for me)
4. Click 'load unpacked' and load this downloaded file
5. Now you can go on youtube, and the homepage should be erased.

## Potential bugs you can run into and potential fixes

1. This script assumes that you can load youtube homepage in less than 2 seconds. If this isn't the case then go to remove-feed.js, and change 2000 to a higher value.
2. It may also be useful to go back to chrome://extensions and view the error messages (if there are any), and you can also pin this extension, or remove it at any time.
